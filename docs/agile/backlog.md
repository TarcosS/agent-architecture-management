## Parallel Work Batches (optional)
- **Batch A (Gate A - no prior deps):** US-001 (PM: PRD), US-006 (Process: Repo Map), TK-014 (Designer: UX Notes) — can run in parallel immediately
- **Batch B (Gate B - after Gate A artifacts):** US-002 (SWE: Tech Plan), US-003 (QA: Test Strategy) — can run in parallel after Batch A
- **Batch C (Gates C & D - after Gate B artifacts):** US-004 (DevOps: Release Checklist), US-008 (Security: Threat Model) — can run in parallel after Batch B
- **Batch D (Gate Scripts - after all artifact gates):** US-005 (Process: Gate Scripts) — runs after Batches A–C are complete (all TK-001 through TK-005 done)
- **Batch E (Delegation):** US-007 (Architect: Create all 7 child issues) — runs after all planning artifacts are ready
